We have all be there. You want to try something new but are afraid you don't know exactly how you will cook it. Or you have never cooked before and want to learn or wish you learned sooner. Well, the best time to do anything was yesterday. The next best time is TODAY!

## What's in your fridge?

Silver Spoon is an application that let's you the user enter whatever you have available in your fridge and make a dish out of it. Silver Spoon will give you step by step directions and walk through the preparation and cooking procedure.

If the ingredients you have provided are unsufficient to prepare a dish, Silver Spoon will build on top of what you have and make you suggestions on certain dish you could prepare by giving you exactly the ingredients you are missing.

## Your food mood

Silver Spoon allow you the user to enter the exact dish that you in a particular mood for, and will return a high definition image of what the dish will look like once completed along with the step by step directions on how to prepare and cook the dish.

## Get Directions

Suppose you are making dinner for family and friends and realized someone in your circle just turn vegan / vegetarian. You want to make them feel included, however you have never cooked any vegan/vegetarian food, what do you do?
Silver Spoon can help. All you have to do is tell it you want to be suggested vegan dish only and Silver Spoon will oblige.

## Random Recipe

Silver Spoon allow you the user to switch things up a bit every once in a while with its suggest me random recipes option. This option allows you, the user, to randomly generate new recipes you have never tried before along with step by step directions, cooking time, servings and a HD picture of what the dish is supposed to look like once completed.
